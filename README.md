# click-challenge

A time-constrained data science analysis I did on click-through rates. For the challenge, I had to quickly download, clean and analyze a data set. I ran a logistic regression in order to formulate a bidding strategy for a hypothetical firm. I did most of this work in one afternoon in September 2019 and was unable to consult manuals, Stack Overflow, etc.
